After i watched the movie, <br>I think this movie is kind of a space version of Robinson Crusoe. question
Can we keep growing potatoes in space?Potatoes, because of their toxic substances called solanins,
do not sprout if re-planted immediately after harvest,
and cannot be re-planted with some of the potatoes to ensure continued food. If you were in such a situation,
how would you act? If that's the case, I'll blame God first. And I will slowly look back on my life and die.
If you were a member of the team, <p style="margin-top:100px;">could you have made</p> such a decision?
Yes, because if I don't go back now, my teammate's life on the mission is in danger and If a team member loses life
by not going back, I can't stand the guilt.
